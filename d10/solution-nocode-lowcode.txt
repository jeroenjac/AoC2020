good old xls 'cheating':

would be relatively ok to code this, e.g.;
- sort the input & determine max; 
	- validate diff between 2 adapters
		- >3 not possible
		- 0 not possible
		- 1 or 3 is ok (my input didn't have 2, believe this a special case/simplification)
- check if adapter is must have or not to connect to 0 to max jolt
- count how many non-must-have ('largest adapter' is must have by definition)
		- in my input: must haves appeared only in pairs of 2 - this should have no impact
- for these 'optionals' you have the option to put them in the chain or not
	- serie of 1 optional: generates 2 options
	- serie of 2 optionals: generates 4 options
	- serie of 3 optionals: generates 7 options
	- serie of >3 optionals: not applicable (there always needs to be one of these 4 must-have)
	(if the diff can be 2, I think it is not as straigthforward to look at the series of 1-3 optionals;
	series become more connected?)
